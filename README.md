# Anthono220 Music Usage Policy

## Be wary of changes.
The Anthono220 Music Usage Policy will never be set in stone and may periodically change over time. It's important to stay updated on what has changed in terms of if, where, when and how you are allowed to perform, use, or alter any Anthono220 music track. Major changes will be announced on the Anthono220.com blog, so if you are frequently using Anthono220 music then please be sure to check regularly.

## A.I. use is strictly prohibited.
You are absolutely not allowed to use ANY of Anthono220's work for any "AI generated" creations without explicit permission. It is art theft, plain and simple. This includes any work from other artists that have collaborated on certain tracks unless you have their explicit permission as well. You are also highly discouraged from using Anthono220's works in the background of any other A.I. generated content or videos containing A.I. generated images.

Examples include but are not limited to: changing vocals in any song to another singer or a character; generating and/or using "original" songs using Anthono220 content as (a) source(s); extending any Anthono220 song.

## Reuploading
You are allowed to reupload original or extended Anthono220 music tracks to any video-sharing platform (YouTube, Peertube, Vimeo, etc.) even if an official video exists, given that you are not directly monetizing off of the video and allowing Anthono220 to monetize off the video if necessary. If you are asked to remove a particular song or version of a song from your channel for any reason, please do so. Please make sure Anthono220 and all respective collaborators are properly credited in the video and/or description of the video and that you are not claiming any songs as yours.

## Remixing and sampling
Remixes are 100% allowed, even with monetization. Versions of songs that are simply edited (slowed, nightcore, etc.) are allowed as well, but should not be monetized and/or put on streaming platforms. It would be preferred if you do not upload edited versions onto streaming platforms. In terms of sampling, it's fine if the sample somewhat enhances the song and is used in small clips (i.e. a vocal sample, given that the vocalist is okay with sampling themselves.) For tracks that use an Anthono220 track significantly (i.e. a trap or lo-fi remix), it's best to ask for explicit permission and perhaps negotiate royalties if neccessary.

## Streaming and Videos
You are allowed to use Anthono220's music in the background of any live streams on any streaming platform (Youtube, Twitch, etc.), even without royalties. It would be greatly appreciated, especially in music streams which feature Anthono220 music, that Anthono220 and respective collaborators are credited when the song name is shown on-screen.

## Game Usage
You are not allowed to use any of Anthono220's music in any video game without explicit permission, especially if they originate from any Anthono220 Media products. Certain exemptions are given to games with user-uploaded content such as osu! and Geometry Dash if songs on Newgrounds have such allowance enabled. If you are asked to remove a song that you have uploaded yourself to a game that allows for user-submitted songs, please do so. Music used in slight fork or ports of open-source Anthono220 Media projects are fine.

## Movies and Shows
In general, you should not use any tracks in your commercial movies or shows without explicit permission. You can, however, use any song if the project is non-commercial, especially in projects related to Anthono220's works, such as fan animations and unofficial documentaries/video essays. Of course, you are allowed to use Anthono220's works for any news coverage or educational purposes, per fair use laws.

## Leaks
It would help a lot if you did not share any leaked or unreleased music tracks.
